                    <p>Graduated from Saint Joseph's College in Standish Maine in May 2016, 
                        Izaak joined the workforce at Liberty Mutual Insurance as a Underwriter 
                        Assistant.
                        <br><br>
                        Without knowing what an underwriter actually did Izaak was excited about
                        the opportunity to be working at a Fortune 100 company.
                        <br><br>
                        After having been on the kob for two years, Liberty Mutual was sold to Lincoln
                        Financial, it was at this point Izaak decided to act and join a UNH coding class.
